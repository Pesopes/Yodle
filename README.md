# Yodle

This is my Wordle clone with some "improvements".
This was just a quick project with javascript and the code is very bad.

Some changes:
- splash text (I don't know who wanted them)
- confetti at the end
- quickly remove word
  - pc: ctrl + backspace
  - mobile: hold the back key
- preview whether word is valid (before entering)
- settings screen
  - change colours
  - change background
  - change name of the game
  - share your settings with others

Some issues:
- bugs with colours in words
- bad scaling on mobile devices
- laggy
- a lot more :(
