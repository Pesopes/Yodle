# Yodle

This is my Wordle clone with some "improvements".
This was just a quick project with javascript and the code is very bad.

Some changes:
- splash text (I don't know who wanted them)
- confetti at the end
- settings screen
  - change colours
  - change background
  - change name of the game
  - share your settings with others

Some issues:
- bugs with colours in words
- bad scaling on mobile devices
- a lot more :(

Hosted on github pages [here](https://pesopes.github.io/Yodle/).
